Credit cards, when used responsibly, can be useful tools in an emergency. Many credit cards offer a cash advance feature that lets you access cash conveniently from an ATM or bank branch. How much cash you can borrow is limited by either a percentage of your card’s limit or a set maximum amount.

Since the cash advance is tied to your existing card’s credit limit, it doesn’t require an additional credit check. Still, credit card cash advances have higher interest rates than your card’s variable APR.
