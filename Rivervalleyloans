Payday loans are a type of instant loan that let you borrow a small amount — usually a few hundred dollars. The repayment term for these loans is extremely short, often within two weeks or by your next pay period.

This kind of emergency loan is generally considered predatory because it charges exorbitant interest rates. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, payday loans typically charge interest as high as 400 percent. Furthermore, borrowers often cannot repay what’s owed by the due date, leading to excessive lender fees, multiple overdraft charges on your bank account and an even deeper debt hole.
